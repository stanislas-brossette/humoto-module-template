This is a simple Humoto module that implements the paper "Trajectory Free Linear Model Predictive Control for Stable Walking in the Presence of Strong Perturbations" by Pierre-Brice Wieber.
This module is very simple and can be a good help to understand the basics of Humoto for beginners.
I tried to make it as clean and clearly commented as possible, but feel free to give me feedbacks.
This is a demo of compiling external modules for Humoto, i.e., modules which are not stored in the main repository of Humoto.

Directory layout:
    humoto          -- a submodule which links the main repository of Humoto;
    extra_modules   -- a folder with extra modules for Humoto containing a
                       single mock example;
    Makefile        -- compilation script for the example module.

The example module is compiled with 'make all' command. You can learn the
necessary cmake parameters for Humoto compilation scripts by reading Makefile.

This module is based on Humoto-module-template.

To compile it, you need to modify the makefile line containing "~/profiles/devel/src/humoto/humoto-core/" and replace it with the location of the humoto-core sources on your system
